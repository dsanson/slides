   al-Ghazālī on the Eternity of the World
nocite: 
---

# Text and Context

*The Incoherence of Philosophy*: "philosophy" here means *falsafah*. This is
an attack on *falsafah*, and so a defense of *kalām*. Al-Ghazālī is often seen
as the person responsible for *synthesizing* the two traditions.

Later, we will read selections from Ibn Rushd's book, *The Incoherence of the Incoherence*, which is an attack on al-Ghazālī's book.

# The Eternity of the World

Did the world come to be at some moment, finitely long ago, or has it always
existed?

As Ghazālī tells us, the dominant view among the philosophers was that the
world is eternal (see Aristotle, *Physics* VIII). But on some readings, at
least, Plato held that the world is not eternal, but created finitely long
ago. Notice that both agree that the world is *created*. It is just that, for
Aristotle, it is created in such a way that it is not temporally posterior to
its creator. Meanwhile, Galen said it was impossible to determine the answer
either way.

# The Strongest Proof

See p. 242. Can we reconstruct this argument? What is al-Ghazālī's response? (see p. 243, "The refutation comes from two fronts..." to ...?)

This passage on p. 245 is relatively to the point:

> Thus, it is incumbent \[upon you\] to construct a logical demonstration that
> shows the impossibility of that, since in all of what you have stated \[you
> have shown\] only improbability and analogy with our resolve and will. On
> the one hand, \[the analogy\] is imperfect; for the eternal will is not
> analogous with temporal intentions. On the other hand, probability taken
> simply is not enough \[to show that the world is eternal\] without a
> demonstration.
>
> It might be said, "We do know by the necessity of reason that what
> necessitates with the completion of its conditions is inconceivable without
> there being what is necessitated, and the one who allows \[otherwise\] is
> showing contempt for the necessity of reason."
>
> We ask what is the difference between you and your opponents when they say
> to you that we necessarily know the inconsistency of the claim, "A single
> entity knows all the universals without that \[knowledge\] requiring
> multiplicity, and without the knowledge being something additional to the
> entity, and without the knowledge being made multiple \[18\] despite the
> multiplicity of objects known"? This is your position concerning God's
> reality, but with respect to us and to what we understand, it is
> inconsistent in the extreme! (245)

# An Argument Against the Eternity of the World

See p. 245-246: paragraphs 22-27

# Another Argument Against the Creation of the World

See p. 248, starting with paragraph 31. What is this argument? What is
Ghazālī's response?
