<h2>Language and Reality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does language distort our understanding of reality?
<ul>
<li>‘2 + 2 = 4’: a truth about mathematical reality, or the product of
our arbitrary decision to use these symbols in this way?</li>
<li>‘Nothing both is and is not’: a basic principle governing all
things, or just a rule of our language?</li>
<li>‘Lying is wrong’: a moral fact, or a misleading way of expressing
your feelings about lying?</li>
<li>Substance-accident metaphysics: just a projection of the
subject-predicate form of language?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does language <em>shape</em> reality?
<ul>
<li>social categories: gender, race, class</li>
<li>binary categorical schemes, negation, contradiction…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="language-and-mind" class="slide level2">
<h2>Language and Mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is language what enables us to think?</li>
<li>Do we think <em>in</em> a language?</li>
<li>Is our ability to think and speak the result of some special magic
power we have, to access a non-physical realm of meaning and
thought?</li>
<li>How are you able to understand sentences you’ve never heard before:
<ul>
<li>‘The purple antelope ate jelly donuts.’</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="language-and-communication" class="slide level2">
<h2>Language and Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Language enables communication.
<ul>
<li>How is it different from other forms of communication?</li>
<li>Communication as sharing <em>information</em>: what is happening far
away, or in the past, etc.</li>
<li>Communication as sharing <em>ideas</em>: how one person reveals
their inner world to another.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non-communicative uses of language?
<ul>
<li>Using language as art (literature, poetry, songs…)</li>
<li>Using language to oppress/control</li>
<li>Using language to include/exclude</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="meanings-and-aboutness" class="slide level2">
<h2>Meanings and Aboutness</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meanings are weird:
<ul>
<li>‘a cat’ doesn’t resemble a cat.</li>
<li>‘a unicorn’ is about a unicorn, but there are no unicorns.</li>
<li>‘a cat’ is about a non-specific cat (?) but there are no
non-specific cats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The picture theory of meaning:
<ul>
<li>the meaning of ‘a cat’ is a mental picture of a cat, and the mental
picture is a picture <em>of a cat</em> because it resembles a cat.</li>
<li>But ‘a cat’ doesn’t resemble that mental picture.</li>
<li>And what a picture is a picture of isn’t determined by what it
resembles:
<ul>
<li>a bad drawing of a cat does not resemble a cat, but is a drawing of
a cat;</li>
<li>a bad drawing of a dog might resemble a cat, but it is of a
dog.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="language-and-languages" class="slide level2">
<h2>Language and Languages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Could there be a perfect language?
<ul>
<li>Adamic language, Lagadonian language, <a
href="https://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html">Universal
language</a></li>
<li>Frege, in his <em>Begriffschrift</em> (“Concept Script”), attempted
to construct purely scientific language, stripped of all poetry and
ambiguity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The value of languages as cultural artifacts?
<ul>
<li>What would we lose if we replaced the diversity of natural languages
with a single pure universal language?</li>
<li>What do we lose when languages are lost?</li>
<li>What do colonized people lose when their pre-colonial languages are
lost?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="syntax-semantics-pragmatics" class="slide level2">
<h2>Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Syntax: how words relate to other words.
<ul>
<li>‘John is easy to please’ ⇒ ‘It is easy to please John’</li>
<li>‘John is eager to please’ ⇏ ‘It is eager to please John’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semantics: how words relate to their meanings.
<ul>
<li>What does the word ‘kangaroo’ mean? What about the word ‘the’?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pragmatics: how words relate to their uses.
<ul>
<li>Implicature: saying one thing but meaning another</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work in <em>Philosophy of Language</em> (as opposed to
<em>Linguistics</em>) tends to focus mostly on semantics and pragmatics,
and that is what we will do in this class.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="use-and-mention" class="slide level2">
<h2>Use and Mention</h2>
<ul>
<li>A word without quotes is <em>used</em>. A word in single quotes is
<em>mentioned</em>:
<ul>
<li>Kangaroos have tails.</li>
<li>‘Kangaroos’ has nine letters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This iterates:
<ul>
<li>‘Kangaroos’ is a word that refers to kangaroos.</li>
<li>‘ ‘Kangaroos’ ’ refers to the word ‘kangaroos’.</li>
<li>‘ ‘ ‘Kangaroos’ ’ ’ refers to ‘ ‘kangaroos’ ’.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-fido-fido-theory-of-meaning" class="slide level2">
<h2>The ‘Fido’-Fido theory of meaning</h2>
<ul>
<li>A word just means what it stands for.<br />
</li>
<li>Troubles:
<ul>
<li>Phrases, sentences, texts have meaning, not just words. What do they
stand for?</li>
<li><em>Terms</em> are words that stand for things, but not every word
is a <em>term</em>: ‘or,’ ‘of,’ ‘if,’ ‘very,’ etc.</li>
<li>Identity problems: ‘7 = the square root of 49’; ‘Superman = Clark
Kent’</li>
<li>Non-referring terms: ‘Santa Claus is a jolly old elf’; ‘Pegasus is a
winged horse’; ‘Sherlock Holmes is a detective.’</li>
<li>Negative existentials: ‘Santa Claus doesn’t exist.’</li>
<li>Attitudes: ‘Lois loves Superman’; ‘Lois does not love Clark
Kent.’</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Next Time: Frege</h2>
<p>For next time, you are reading basically one page from Frege’s “On
sense and reference”. This is an attack on the ‘Fido’-Fido theory of
meaning. It is dense! Work through it carefully.</p>

<h2>‘Haddocks’ Eyes’</h2>
<div class="line-block">“The name of the song is called ‘<em>Haddocks’
Eyes</em>’.”<br />
“Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?” Alice said, trying to feel
interested.<br />
“No, you don’t understand,” the Knight said, looking a little
vexed.<br />
“That’s what the name is called. The name really is ‘<em>The Aged Aged
Man</em>’.”<br />
“Then I ought to have said ‘That’s what the song is called’?” Alice
corrected herself.<br />
“No, you oughtn’t: that’s quite another thing! The song is called
‘<em>Ways And Means</em>’: but that’s only what it’s called, you
know!”<br />
“Well, what is the song, then?” said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.<br />
“I was coming to that,” the Knight said. “The song really is
‘<em>A-sitting On A Gate</em>’: and the tune’s my own invention.”</div>

<section id="lagadonian-language" class="slide level2">
<h2>Lagadonian Language</h2>
<p>Gulliver visits the grand academy at Lagado. One professor is working
on extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, another is working on recreating
food out of human shit, another on building houses from the top down,
and so forth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat
in consultation upon improving that of their own country.</p>
<p>The first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables
into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality,
all things imaginable are but nouns.</p>
<p>The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words
whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,
as well as brevity. For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in
some degree, a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and, consequently,
contributes to the shortening of our lives. An expedient was therefore
offered, “that since words are only names for things, it would be more
convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary
to express a particular business they are to discourse on.” And this
invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as
health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and
illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be
allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of
their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are
the common people. However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to
the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this
inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and
of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater
bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong
servants to attend him. I have often beheld two of those sages almost
sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who,
when they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their
sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their
implements, help each other to resume their burdens, and take their
leave.</p>
