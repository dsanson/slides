The goal here is to generate several very short videos (max 6 minutes) in
support of a flipped classroom, for my Fall 2023 course, Philosphy in the
Islamic World.

# Topics

"Islam": tell the basic origin story; the Tawhid and monotheism

"The Islamic World": extent, geography, status of non-Muslim "people of the book" and others.

"The House of Wisdom": translation project; Greek and Hellenistic sources

"Falsafah and KalƒÅm":

"Against Dualism": early arguments for monotheism against Manicheaism

A whirlwind tour of Greek thought (see also the introduction to @mcginnis2007, II)
