# Why Language?

-   Mind, language, world
    -   concepts, words, things
-   "That's just semantics" and "That's nonsense."
-   What is truth?
-   The problem of other minds
-   Puzzles about intentionality: How can one thing be *about* another?

# Is Language Special?

-   The power of words: does your name reveal something about you? 
-   Instantaneous action at a distance? A sentence is true here because of events there.
-   Language as unique to humans?
-   How can a small vocabulary generates an infinite number of meaningful sentences?
-   Perfect languages? (Adamic language, Lagadonian language, a [universal language](https://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html))

# Language is Normal

-   Just one more form of intelligent collaboration––games, family, hunting  
-   Natural meaning: spots means measles, smoke means fire...
-   Combinatorics apply to other things too: atoms have an infinite range of possible combinations.  

# Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics  

Syntax
:   how words relate to other words.

Semantics
:   how words relate to their meanings.

Pragmatics
:    how words relate to their uses.  

# Example: 'Fuck'

-   Syntactic issues:
    -   'Fuck' is not a verb in 'Fuck you':
        [more](https://the-toast.net/?p=19857)
    -   expletive infixation: 'un-fucking-believable'
-   Semantic issues:
    -   Is the difference in offensiveness or inappropriateness between 'fuck'
        and 'copulate' a difference in meaning?
    -   When used as an insult ('Fuck you!'), or an exclamation ('Oh fuck!')
        what the fuck does 'fuck' even mean?
-   Pragmatic issues:
    -   'Fuck you' is an insult, a telling off. Maybe that is less about what
        'fuck' means, and more about how we *use* it?
    -   Why are some uses of 'fuck' chummy and others not?
    -   Just focusing on the copulative sense, what makes 'Wanna fuck?' a
        different speech act from 'Would you like to have sex with me?'

# More Syntactic Problems

-   'John is easy to please': 'John' is the *object* of 'please'.
-   'John is eager to please': 'John' is the *subject* of 'please'.
-   How the does that work? The *surface grammar* of English does not appear
    to offer enough structure to explain this difference.

<aside class=notes>

-   'John is easy to please' == 'It is easy to please John'.
-   'John is eager to please =/= 'It is eager to please John'.

# Use and Mention

-   Historically, quotation marks are a recent invention.
-   Consider:
    -   Fish have gills.
    -   'Fish' has four letters.
    -   'Fish' is a word of English.
    -   ''Fish'' names a word of English.
-   How does our language manage to have a mechanism that allows us to use
    words as names for themselves?

# Semantics: the 'Fido'-Fido theory

-   The ‘Fido’-Fido theory of meaning: A word just means what it stands for.  
-   Troubles:
    -   Phrases, sentences, texts have meaning, not just words. What do they stand for?
    -   *Terms* are words that stand for things, but not every word is a *term*: ‘or,’ ‘of,’ ‘if,’ ‘very,’ etc.
    -   Identity problems: '7 = the square root of 49'; 'Superman = Clark Kent'
    -   Non-referring terms: 'Santa Claus is a jolly old elf'; 'Pegasus is a winged horse'; 'Sherlock Holmes is a detective.'
    -   Negative existentials: 'Santa Claus doesn't exist.'
    -   Attitudes: 'Lois loves Superman'; 'Lois does not love Clark Kent.'

# Pragmatics

-   Implicature: saying one thing but meaning another
    -   The captain was sober today.  
    -   'He got on his horse and rode off into the sunset' vs. 'He rode off into the sunset and got on his horse'.
-   Speech acts
    -   'I do' and 'sold!'

# Frege

For next time, you are reading basically one page from Frege's "On sense and
reference". This is an attack on the 'Fido'-Fido theory of meaning. It is dense! Work through it carefully.
