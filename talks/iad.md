# *The Final Word: al-Dawani and the Liar Paradox in the Islamic World*

-   How it began:
    -   al-Dawānī (d. 1502)'s treatise, *The Final Word in Solving the Paradox
        of the Irrational Root*, looks neat! Let's translate it and
        reconstruct what it says.

-   What it's become:
    -   an overly ambitious attempt to reconstruct the entire known history of
        the paradox within the Islamic world, up to and including al-Dawānī.

-   Why this happened:
    -   al-Dawānī discusses several earlier proposals, offering partial
        quotes, so we chased those back to their sources.
    -   turns out he isn't always faithful to his sources[, and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some important figures]{.fragment} [, and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some curious uses of the Liar in theological
        contexts.]{.fragment}

# Yaḥyá Ibn ʿAdī (d. 947)

-   Syriac Christian, working in Baghdad, b. 893; d. 974
-   Student of Abū Bishr Mattā; student or colleague of al-Fārābī.
-   Known in his time especially for his work on logic.
-   Translator of works by Plato, Aristotle, and others, including:
    -   Aristotle, *Categories*, *Topics*, *Sophistical Refutations*;
    -   Alexander of Aphrodisias, *On Categories*
-   Wrote commentaries, including on:
    -   Aristotle*, *Categories*, *De Interpretatione*, *Prior and Posterior
        Analytics*, *Topics*, *Sophistical Refutations*, *Isagoge\*
-   Author of several independent treatises, including several on logic.


# Sadr al-Dīn al-Dashtakī (d. 1498)

-   Philosopher living and working in Shiraz during the Safavid period.
-   Contemporary of, and interlocutor with, al-Dawānī.
-   *The Final Word* is the final word in *their* extended debate about the Liar.

   
# 932: Abū Bishr Mattā vs. al-Sirāfī

-    Famous public debate on the relative merits of (Greek) logic and Arabic grammar.
-    Abū Bishr Mattā is reported to have argued,

     > The logician does not need grammar, whereas the grammarian has a strong need
     > for logic, because logic investigates meaning (*maʿnā*) whereas grammar
     > investigates utterance (*lafẓ*).[@al-tawhidi2019, 125]

# Ibn ʿAdī, *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic*

-   Part of the Tehran codex Marwī 19 discovered by Robert Wisnovsky
    (@wisnovsky2012).

-   Full title: *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic by Describing how
    it Benefits People \[by endowing them\] with Powers \[to dissolve
    problems\] that it is Impossible for the other Arts of Language to Solve*.

-   Logic studies meaning, the other linguistic arts study utterance, so logic
    can make distinctions that they cannot:

    > The people of logic divide the saying, 'The standing other than the
    > sitting (*al-qāʾim ghayr al-qāʿid*),' in 16384 ways \[=$2^14$\], as we
    > will explain, whereas the other practical arts are unable to do so.

-   It also enables us to solve problems:

    > Another benefit of logic is to dissolve some common problems that were
    > brought by the sophists.

We have not verified that Ibn ʿAdī actually produces 16384 readings.

# Four Problems

1.  The Liar:

    > Tell us about he who
    > says, 'All my sayings (*qawl*) are false,' if he has not spoken before, other
    > than by declaring the falsity of them as a whole. Do you judge his
    > saying to be false or true? For if you necessitate that it is true, then
    > it must be false, and this necessarily entails that his saying is true
    > and false together, and it is one saying.

2.   Everyone who says he is a donkey is truthful
   
3.   Every man has many species
   
4.   Body is either animal or not animal, so either rock is animal or
        animal is not animal.

-   Ibn ʿAdī leaves solutions to these problems as an exercise for the reader.

-   Thankfully, a friend or patron read *Explaining* and asked for solutions, which are provided in a separate treatise, *The Virtue of Logic*.
   
:::notes

-   This is pretty much the standard from the Liar takes throughout the
    tradition.

-   Later, it becomes common to replace 'All my sayings' with 'All my sayings
    at this moment', stipulating that this is the only thing the
    speaker says at this moment.


>| Everyone who says he is a donkey says he is an animal.
>| Everyone who says he is an animal is truthful. 
>| So, everyone who says he is donkey is truthful.

Haven't located Greek sources; present in the earliest Oxford and Paris collections of sophisms.

>| Every man is an animal. 
>| Animal has many species.
>| So every man has many species.

As standard puzzle from antiquity. See @dexippus2014 [bk. 1, sec. 27, p. 55]
@porphyry1992 [80:32, pp. 65-66] and @back1987 [p. 140ff].

A puzzle about Aristotle's *dictum de omni et nullo* (*Categories* 1b
10-15) that the later Islamic tradition associates with Isagoge.

# Ibn ʿAdī's source for the Liar?

-   @endress1977 [p. 44] suggests that Ibn ʿAdī's sources for the Liar were
    Aristotle's *Sophistical Refutations 25*, and Alexander's commentary on
    *SR*.
-   Not *SR* 25:
    -   *SR* 25 at best *suggests* the Liar [@spade1973a] 
    -   The suggestive example from *SR* 25---a man who "at the same time says what is both false and
    true"---is omitted from many of the Arabic translations, including Ibn
    ʿAdī's [@alwishah2009a, 99]
-   Not Alexander's commentary on *SR*:
    -   Discusses the Liar[, but is now understood to be spurious, actually written by Michael of Ephesus in the 12th century CE.]{.fragment}
-   Alexander's commentary on *Topics* II.7:
    -   Discusses the Liar and not spurious [@alexander2020 188:4-189:10].
    -   Ibn ʿAdī says he consulted it when writing his own commentary on *Topics* [but also says that his copy was
    missing Alexander's commentary on books II, III, and IV [@endress1977, 25]]{.fragment}.

:::notes

Our guess: puzzles like the Liar were part of the standard logic curriculum, presented as exercises to students by teachers.

:::

# Ibn ʿAdī's Solution

-   The Liar is false:

    > This saying (*al-qawl*) is false, and it is not possibly true. 

-   It is false because one of his sayings is not false:

    > For he is declaring about the totality of [his] sayings (*aqqāwilī*), and one of
    > them is the saying that all of them are false, and it is not the case that
    > the totality of other sayings that he declared (*khabar*) to be false are
    > false. Hence the saying that they are false is true.

-   But that's weird, because the Liar is supposed to be his only saying.

:::notes

A "declared-about" (*mukhbar ʿanhu*) is the subject of a declarative. If I
say, 'Zayd is sitting', Zayd, the man, is the declared-about. If I say, 'All
my students are from Illinois', each individual student is a declared-abouts.

5.  As a declared-about, L is neither true nor false.
6.  As a declarative, L declares that all its declared-abouts are false.
7.  So, as a declarative, L is false.
8.  So, L is false.

1.  When I declare, '"Zayd is standing" is a declarative', I do not declare 'Zayd is standing'.
2.  Likewise in other cases.
3.  So, when a declarative is made the declared-about of another declarative, it exits from being a declarative.

# Three Distinctions

Ibn ʿAdī,the declared-about declarative,the declaring declarative
Avicenna,the proposition taken as part of a conditional,the proposition inspected externally
Recanati,the displayed sentence,the sentence that ostends the displayed sentence
```

The funky thing about the Liar is that the act of *displaying* appears to be *identical to* the act of *declaring* something about what is displayed.

# Worries

1.  Over-generalization:
    -   Ibn ʿAdī's principle is not just about quotation, but all cases in
        which declaratives are declared-abouts.
    -   In some of those cases, like quotation and the Liar, the
        declared-about is displayed, and doesn't have independent existence.
    -   But when I say, 'Ahmed's declarative is false', Ahmed's declarative is
        not displayed, and has independent existence.
  
2.  Implausible consequences, ineffability and self-defeat:
    -   Ibn ʿAdī's principle implies that 'Some saying is a declarative' is
        false, which is implausible.
    -   On Ibn ʿAdī's principle, all features of declaratives that depend on
        their being declaratives are ineffable: when you try to say that
        declarative has such a feature, it exits from being a declarative, and
        so loses that that feature, and so your claim is false.
    -   Specifically, all the claims that Ibn ʿAdī makes about declaratives in
        his attempt to solve the Liar are, according to his own account,
        false.

# al-Dashtakī's initial presentation of the Liar

> If you say: If what has been determined is correct, namely,
> that the correctness and truth of a judgment is by its correspondence to the
> external or the *nafs al-amr*, and its falsity by its absence,
> \[then this\] entails that truth and falsity are not conjoined in one

> the mentioned moment, other than this speech, then the truth of his
> declarative entails its falsity and vis versa. [@qaramaleki2007, 3]

-   The background here is a correspondence theory of truth that traces back
    to Avicenna via al-Ṭūsī, and *nafs al-amr* is a technical term within that
    theory for the thing itself, as it is independent of the judgment that is
    meant to correspond to it.
-   That's a whole other talk!

# al-Dashtakī's solution

> [Falsity is considered in this specific saying twice]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}, and [being considered twice,
> this requires two declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth and
> falsity to it]{.fragment fragment-index="2" .highlight-current-green}.

1.  [The Liar is a declarative that considers falsity twice.]{.fragment
    .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}
2.  [Any declarative that considers truth or falsity twice requires the
    actualization of two declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth

3.  [In the case of the Liar, only one declarative is actualized.]{.fragment

:::

# Our Assessment

-   al-Dashtakī offers a complicated argument in defense of (2).
-   We think (with al-Dawānī) that his argument does not support (2).
-   Mostly, the problem is that al-Dashtakī mis-generalizes: his reasoning
    instead supports another principle similar to (2), which can be used to
    support some of his conclusions---including the conclusion that the Liar
    is neither true nor false---but cannot be used to support everything he
    wants to say.

# Truth, Falsity, and Existential Import

> [](#fw71) Know that each one of truth and falsity requires the
> actualization of the attributed-about (*al-mawṣūf*) that they are attributed
> to.

-   Three claims that all parties (except Ibn Kammūna) agree to:

    1.  Falsity is the privative negation ("absence of") or metathetic
        negation ("non-") of truth.
    2.  Attributions of privative and metathetic negations are affirmative.
    3.  Affirmative attributions have existential import.

# A stalking horse

@zarepour2023 (a lovely paper!) suggests that Dashtakī's reasoning
relies on the Principle of Compositionality:

> Dashtakī's argument here seems to be based on a version of what is today
> called the Principle of Compositionality. Roughly speaking, this principle
> states that the meaning [...] of a complex

> a sentence does not express any semantic content at all. Moreover, if a
> sentence does not express a semantic content, it will not be either true or
> false. No meaningless sentence is truth-apt. [-@zarepour2023, 12--13]

:::{.fragment}
For a long time, we read Dashtakī this way too. But now we think that is a
mistake, and his reasoning just depends on the much weaker and more
traditional claim, that affirmatives have existential import.

-    If L is actualized, then one of 'L is true' and 'L is false' is correct.
-    If L is missing, neither of 'L is true' and 'L is false' is correct.
-    ('correct', in this context, just means 'true')
-    If L is missing, both 'L is true' is not true and 'L is false' is not true.

That is, 

:::nonincremental
-   [the truth or falsity of ZTT or ZTF]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"} [requires the actualization of
both Z and ZT]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index="2"}.

-   So, [if Z is actualized but ZT is not]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index="3"},
    then [both ZTT and ZTF are not correct]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index=5}

# And...


Here, we can Samarqandī's claim that,

> [¶](#samarqandi3.2)
> It is *as if* he spoke this speech, and then said again, 'This speech is false.'

Of course, neither Dashtakī nor Samarqandī are claiming that this *is* what
the speaker said. The idea is instead that this is how we need to *understand*
what the speaker did, where this understanding is what should guide our semantic analysis. And this is an idea we can see all the way back in Ibn
ʿAdī: we need to distinguish the act of putting the speech on the table, as it
were---that is, *displaying or presenting* the speech---from the act of
*declaring* or *judging* something about that speech. Here is Dashtakī's explanation of this idea:

> I am not saying that the one who judges (*hākim*) \[the
> declarative\] is aware of the condition of the judgment, that is, that his
> speech is this specific saying, rather I say that he is judging a judgment
> that reaches and covers this saying, and its truth is by affirmation of
> the predicate to this saying, and its falsity is by the absence of that
> affirmation. (Qaramelki, *Risala*, p. 56)

Supposing we grant all this, we now come to the pay-off:

> [](#fw76) And it becomes apparent that the falsity is considered in
> this specific saying twice, and being considered twice, this requires two
> declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth and falsity to it.
> Since only one declarative is actualized, it is clear to
> you that it is not correct to attribute to this saying truth, and not [correct to attribute] falsity.
> And it weighs the same as your saying,
> "'Zayd's sentence is false,' is true", or "false", if Zayd has no
> declarative except one. Reflect on that!
