Abū Mattā:

> The logician does not need grammar, whereas the grammarian has a strong need
> for logic, because logic investigates meaning (*maʿnā*) whereas grammar
> investigates utterance (*lafẓ*).[@al-tawhidi2019, 125; @adamson2015b,

## *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic*

-   One of the manuscripts found by Robert Wisnovsky in the Tehran codex Marwī 19.
-   Logic studies meaning not utterance, so it can make distinctions that the
    linguistic arts cannot.
    -   Here are 16384(!) senses of 'the standing other than the sitting'
        (*al-qāʾim ghayr al-qāʿid*)
-   Four "common problems raised by the sophists" that we can solve using the
    power of logic:
    -   He who says, 'All my sayings are false,' if he has not spoken
        before...
    -   Everyone who says he is a donkey is truthful.
    -   Every man has many species.
    -   Body is either animal or not animal, so either rock is animal or
        animal is not animal.
-   (Solutions left as an exercise for the reader.)

10-15) that the later tradition associates with Isagoge.

What was Ibn ʿAdī's source for the Liar?

-   Alexander's commentary on *Topics* II.7 [@alexander2020, p. 113, 188:4-189:10; @mignucci1999a; @kunne2014]?
-   Ibn ʿAdī tells us that he consulted this commentary when writing his own commentary on the *Topics*   
-   But he also tells us that Alexanders comments on *Topics* II were missing from his copy.[@endress1977, p. 25]

Our guess: puzzles like the Liar were part of the standard logic curriculum, presented as exercises to students by teachers.

## The Liar

Here is how he presents the problem:

> Tell us about he who says, 'All my sayings are false,' if he has not
> spoken before, other than by declaring the falsity of them as a whole.
> Do you judge his saying to be false or true? For if you insist
> that it is true, then it must be false, and this necessarily entails
> that his saying is true and false together, and it is one saying.

:::notes 

This is the standard form the Liar takes throughout the tradition. It
is a Contingent Liar, in Kripke's sense, and obviously so. Generally speaking,
proposed solutions will be sensitive to that.

## *The Virtue of Logic*

-   Thankfully, a friend or patron read *Explaining*, and asked for solutions!
-   Thankfully, with the discovery of *Explaining*, we have a full picture of
    how this text fits into his broader project

## Ibn ʿAdī's Solution

The Liar is false:

> This saying (*al-qawl*) is false, and it is not possibly true. 

It is false because one of his sayings is not false:

> For he is declaring about the totality of [his] sayings (*aqqāwilī*), and one of
> them is the saying that all of them are false, and it is not the case that
> the totality of other sayings that he declared (*khabar*) to be false are
> false. Hence the saying that they are false is true.

But that's weird, because the Liar is supposed to be his only saying.

---

> For in entering into its totality, and declaring about the totality of which
> it is one, [the saying is a declarative about itself]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-red}, too, and [it becomes a declarative (*khabar*) and
> a declared-about (*mukhbar ʿanhu*)]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}. And
> [each declarative that is posited as a declared-about, exits in this
> condition from being a declarative]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}.
> [So, this saying, insofar as it is a declaring about itself, is not a
> declarative]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}, and [each saying that is
> not a declarative is neither true nor false]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-red}, and [if this saying is posited as \[a
> declared-about\] it is neither true nor false]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-red}.

:::notes

A "declared-about" (*mukhbar ʿanhu*) is the subject of a declarative. If I
say, 'Zayd is sitting', Zayd, the man, is the declared-about. If I say, 'All
my students are from Illinois', each individual student is a declared-abouts.

:::

---

1.  L is both a declarative and a declared-about.
2.  When a declarative is posited as a declared-about, it "exits in this
    condition from being" a declarative.
3.  As declared-about, L is not a declarative .
4.  Sayings that are not declaratives are neither true nor false.
5.  So, as a declared-about, L is neither true nor false.
6.  As a declarative, L declares that all its declared-abouts are false.
7.  So, as a declarative, L is false.

----

> And because [it is declaring about itself that it is false, in the case in
> which it is neither true nor false]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}, it
> is false and must not be true. For in order for it to be true it must

## Exiting

2.  When a declarative is posited as a declared-about, it "exits in this
    condition from being" a declarative.

> As for [the claim that] if the declarative is posited as a
> declared-about, it exits in this condition from being a declarative,
> this is something that can be explained by induction. For if you say
> '"Zayd is standing" is a declarative', and '"ʿAmran is running" is a
> declarative', and '"Bread is beneficial" [...],' you are not declaring, in all
> these sayings, that Zayd is standing, or that ʿAmran is running, or that
> Bread is beneficial, and this applies to all other declaratives.

## All declaratives must be declared

The background idea here seems to be that if a saying is not *declared*, it is not a declarative.

Z
:   Zayd is standing.

ZD
:   'Zayd is standing' is a declarative.

When I declare ZD, I do not declare Z. Since Z is not declared, it is not a
declarative. So ZD is false. 

:::notes

Note that it is in many ways similar to the Frege-Geach point: when I declare
a conditional, I do not declare the antecedent or consequent. Yet, for
purposes of analysis, we want the antecedent and consequent to retain the
semantic features granted on the Aristotelian picture only to declaratives.
The same is true about quotation, especially when we want to use quotation to
discuss the semantic features of the quoted sayings.

It is not as though Aristotelians weren't aware of these problems. Avicenna,
for example, is quite explicit about the point that the parts of a
hypothetical judgment are not themselves judged.

## A Davidsonian Thought

Here is a lovely quote from @recanati2001 [639], about quotation:

> In quotation, as several authors have emphasized (Christensen 1967, Searle
> 1969, §4.1, Read forthcoming), the quoted material is displayed or
> presented. That means that a token is produced and the attention of the
> audience is drawn to that token. To be sure, whenever one says something,
> one produces (tokens of) words, with the intention that the audience
> perceive them. Yet one does not normally intend the addressee to pay
> conscious attention to the words one utters. In linguistic communication,
> the words are automatically processed, and audience attention is drawn to
> what one says rather than to the means by which one says it. When words are
> mentioned, however, the medium itself is brought to the forefront of
> attention: the words are displayed, exhibited. This is a form of ostension,
> as Davidson and others have pointed out, but it differs from ordinary
> ostension in one respect: the ostended token does not exist independently of
> the act of ostending it. When I point to a bird, the bird exists independent
> of my pointing, but when I mention a word, the ostended token is
> produced---it comes into being---through the very act of ostensive display.

## Applying that Distinction 

The kind of quotation involved in ZD involves two distinct acts:

-   The act of producing 'Zayd is standing' to be *presented or displayed*.
-   The act of declaring, about that, that it is a declarative.

As Ibn ʿAdī says, the first act is not an act of declaring. So the *displayed*
saying---the saying as declared-about---is not a declarative. If it is the act
of declaring that making a saying truth apt, the *displayed* saying, 'Zayd is
standing', is not truth apt.

## Not all declared-abouts...

What if someone *else* declares Z, and then I declare,

ZD*
:    What they said is a declarative.

Does *their* declarative, when posited as a declared-about, also exit from
being a declarative?

To be sure, *I* don't declare it when I declare ZD\*. But *they* declared it.
Why should it lose its declarativity when I go to declare something about it?

## Ineffability and Self-defeat

Ibn ʿAdī makes all sorts of declarative claims about declaratives. But his own
analysis appears to say that, the moment you try to talk *about* a
declarative, it exits from being a declarative.

## Back to the Liar

The funky thing about L, on this analysis, is that it would appear to be
produced in a *single act*, *both* to be displayed, *and* as an act of
declaring something about itself.

Surely in that case, at least, a declarative need not lose its status as
declarative in the condition of being a declared-about?

Later in the tradition, Fakr al-Din al-Razi (1149-1210) will argue that these acts *must* be distinct: 

> the declarative about something is later in order than the declared-about
> (*mukhbar 'anhu*). So if we made the declarative the same as the
> declared-about, then that entails that the thing is later in order than
> itself, and that is impossible.

It is unclear from context whether 'later in order' here means later in
*time*, or later in some logical or conceptual order. Perhaps Ibn ʿAdī has
something like this idea in mind.
