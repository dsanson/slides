# Introduction

## *The Final Word: al-Dawani and the Liar Paradox in the Islamic World*

-   How it began:
    -   al-Dawānī (d. 1502)'s treatise, *The Final Word in Solving the Paradox
        of the Irrational Root*, looks neat! Let's translate it and
        reconstruct what it says.

-   What it's become:
    -   an overly ambitious attempt to reconstruct the entire known history of
        the paradox within the Islamic world, up to and including al-Dawānī.

-   Why this happened:
    -   al-Dawānī discusses several earlier proposals, offering partial
        quotes, so we chased those back to their sources.
    -   turns out he isn't always faithful to his sources[, and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some important figures]{.fragment} [, and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some curious uses of the Liar in theological
        contexts.]{.fragment}

## Our two characters

### Yaḥyá Ibn ʿAdī (d. 947)

:::nonincremental
-   Syriac Christian, working in Baghdad, b. 893; d. 974
-   Student of Abū Bishr Mattā; student or colleague of al-Fārābī.
-   Prolific translator, commentator, and author of his own treatises.
-   Known in his time especially for his work on logic.

### Sadr al-Dīn al-Dashtakī (d. 1498)

:::nonincremental
-   Philosopher living and working in Shiraz during the Safavid period.
-   Contemporary of, and interlocutor with, al-Dawānī.
-   *The Final Word* is the final word in *their* extended debate about the
    Liar---so he is a central figure for us.
-   In 1497, the new provincial ruler of Shiraz abolished the tax exemption on
    endowment income for his school, so in 1498, he led an armed uprising, for
    which he was executed [@pourjavady2011a, 19].

# Ibn ʿAdī on the Liar

## Context

-    In 932, in a famous public debate on the relative merits of (Greek) logic and (Arabic) grammar.
-    Abū Bishr Mattā argued,

     > The logician does not need grammar, whereas the grammarian has a strong need
     > for logic, because [logic investigates meaning (*maʿnā*) whereas grammar
     > investigates utterance (*lafẓ*).]{.fragment .highlight-current-green}

-    The Liar occurs in two closely related works by Ibn ʿAdī, in which he develops and defends this position:

     -    *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic*
     -    *The Virtues of Logic*, a solution manual to *Explaining*

## *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic*

-   Full title: *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic by Describing how
    it Benefits People \[by endowing them\] with Powers \[to dissolve
    problems\] that it is Impossible for the other Arts of Language to Solve*.

-   Was long lost. Part of the Tehran codex Marwī 19 discovered by Robert Wisnovsky
    (@wisnovsky2012).

-   Part I:

    > The logicians divide the saying, 'The standing other than the
    > sitting (*al-qāʾim ghayr al-qāʿid*),' in 16384 ways \[=$2^14$\], as we
    > will explain, whereas the other practical arts are unable to do so.

-   Part II:

    > Another benefit of logic is to dissolve some common problems that were
    > brought by the sophists.

## Four Problems

1.   The Liar.

2.   Everyone who says he is a donkey is truthful
   
3.   Every man has many species
   
4.   Body is either animal or not animal, so either rock is animal or
     animal is not animal.

-   Solutions are left as an exercise for the reader.

-   Luckily, a friend reached out, asking for a solution manual, so Ibn ʿAdī wrote *Virtues*.

## Ibn ʿAdī's presentation of the Liar in *Explaining*

> .highlight-green },' if [he has not spoken
> before]{.fragment .highlight-green}, other than by
> declaring the falsity of them as a whole.

-   Pretty much the standard form the Liar takes throughout the tradition.
-   Popular later variants are 'All my sayings at this moment are false" and
    "All my sayings in this house are false'.
-   We also find Liar cycles and the Truthteller.

## Ibn ʿAdī's Solution

-   The Liar is false:

    > This saying (*al-qawl*) is false, and it is not possibly true. 

-   It is false because one of his sayings is not false:

    > For he is declaring about the totality of [his] sayings, and one of
    > them is the saying that all of them are false, and it is not the case that
    > the totality of other sayings that he declared to be false are
    > false. So, the saying that they are false is true.

-   But that's weird, because the Liar is supposed to be his only saying.

:::notes

A "declared-about" (*mukhbar ʿanhu*) is the subject of a declarative. If I
say, 'Zayd is sitting', Zayd, the man, is the declared-about. If I say, 'All
my students are from Illinois', each individual student is a declared-abouts.

## A Davidsonian thought about quotation 

-   When you quote a passage in order to say something about it, you do *two* things:

    -    You *present* or *display* the passage, for your audience to consider.
    -    You say something *about* the displayed passage.

-   Perhaps Ibn ʿAdī's idea can be put this way: 
 
    1.   As a declared-about, a declarative is *displayed*.
    2.   To *display* a declarative is not to declare it.
    3.   A declarative is no longer a declarative if it is in a condition where it is not declared.
    4.   As a declared-about, a declarative is no longer a declarative.

-   So the saying *in itself*, which is a declarative, and the very same
    saying *as a declared-about*, where it is not a declarative.

## A Frege-Geach thought about exiting from being a declarative

-   In *al Qiyas* V 236, Avicenna discusses the status of propositions that
    are parts of conditionals, saying,

    > \[When\] a condition is \[stated\], each of two parts will no longer
    > be a proposition (*qaddiya*).

    and so, he says, they are neither true nor false, and so cannot be assented to our doubted.

-   We take it that Ibn ʿAdī's treatment of quotation is very much in the same
    spirit, and motivated by the same background Aristotelian views about the
    role of judging or declaring in constituting a truth-apt representation.

## A few pretty obvious objections

1.  Over-generalization: what he says perhaps applies to quotation, where the
    declared-about is displayed. But why think that extends to cases in which
    the declared-about is not displayed?
    -   e.g., 'That thing you said last night is true', 'All declaratives are
        true or false.'
 
2.  Identity: in the case of the Liar, the declared-about is displayed. But
    the act of displaying is numerically identical to the act of declaring.
    So, in this case, the declared-about is declared.
    -    the same goes for other self-referential declaratives, like 'This saying is in English.'
  
3.  Implausible consequences, ineffability and self-defeat:
    -   This view implies that 'Some saying is a declarative' is
        false, which is implausible.
    -   On this view, features of declaratives that depend on
        their being declaratives are ineffable: when you try to say that
        declarative has such a feature, it exits from being a declarative, and
        so loses that that feature, and so your claim is false.
    -   On this view, all the claims that Ibn ʿAdī makes about declaratives in
        his attempt to solve the Liar are, on his own account, false.

## Ibn ʿAdī's source for the Liar?

-   @endress1977 [p. 44] suggests that Ibn ʿAdī's sources for the Liar were
    Aristotle's *Sophistical Refutations 25*, and Alexander's commentary on
    *SR*.
-   Not *SR* 25:
    -   *SR* 25 at best *suggests* the Liar [@spade1973a] 
    -   The suggestive example from *SR* 25---a man who "at the same time says what is both false and
    true"---is omitted from many of the Arabic translations, including Ibn
    ʿAdī's [@alwishah2009a, 99]
-   Not Alexander's commentary on *SR*:
    -   because it is spurious, written by Michael of Ephesus in the 12th century CE.
-   Could be Alexander's commentary on *Topics* II.7:
    -   Not spurious! Discusses the Liar and not spurious [@alexander2020 188:4-189:10].
    -   Ibn ʿAdī says he consulted it when writing his own commentary on *Topics* [but also says that his copy was
    missing Alexander's commentary on books II, III, and IV [@endress1977, 25]]{.fragment}.

:::notes

Our guess: puzzles like the Liar were part of the standard logic curriculum, presented as exercises to students by teachers.

# al-Dashtakī on the Liar

## al-Dashtakī's initial presentation of the Liar

al-Dashtakī first raises the Liar as an objection to Ṭūsī's claim that truth
is correspondence to the *nafs al-amr* (roughly, the thing as it is in itself), and falsity the absence of this
correspondence:

> \[This\] entails that truth and falsity are not conjoined in one
> declarative. But they may be conjoined in it, as in the saying of he who
> says, 'All my speeches at this moment are false': if he does not speak at
> the mentioned moment, other than this speech, then the truth of his
> declarative entails its falsity and vis versa.

## al-Dashtakī's proposed solution

The Liar is neither true nor false, because it requires, to be truth apt, the
actualization of two declaratives. But only one declarartive is actualized:

> [Falsity is considered in this specific saying twice]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}, and [being considered twice,
> this requires two declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth and
> falsity to it]{.fragment fragment-index="2" .highlight-current-green}.
> Since [only one declarative is actualized]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index=3}, it is clear to you
> that [it is not correct to attribute to this saying truth, and not \[correct
> to attribute\] falsity]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index=4}.

:::

## Truth, Falsity, and Existential Import

al-Dashtakī says:

> [](#fw71) Know that each one of truth and falsity requires the actualization
> of the attributed-about (*al-mawṣūf*) that they are attributed to.

-   Everyone (except maybe Ibn Kammūna) agrees that:

    1.  Falsity is non-truth, that is, the privative or metathetic negation of truth.
    2.  Attributions of privative and metathetic negations are affirmative.
    3.  Affirmative attributions have existential import.
        -   'A is B' is true only if 'A' is not empty; otherwise it is false.
        -   'A is not B' is true if 'A' is empty.

-   So, since 'A is true' and 'A is false' are both affirmative, they both
    require (for their *truth*) the actualization of A---that is, that 'A' not
    be empty.

## (A stalking horse)

@zarepour2023 [12--13] (a lovely paper!) says:

> Dashtakī's argument here seems to be based on a version of what is today
> called the Principle of Compositionality. 

On this interpretation, if 'A' is empty, both 'A is B' and 'A is not B' are meaningless, and so lack
truth value (unless one does something fancy with the semantics of 'not').

:::{.fragment}
For a long time, we read Dashtakī this way too. But now we think that is a
mistake. Dashtaki's reasoning depends on the weaker  traditional claim that 
affirmatives have existential import.

-   '✗' is not a truth value. It just indicates that the possibility that Z

-   On our preferred interpretation, "correct" here means "true", and "false"
    is the metathetic negation of "true", so any declarative that is not
    correct is therefore false.

-   But this violates Dashtakī's stated principle: it is correct to attribute
    falsity to ZTF, even though both Z and ZT are not actualized.
-   Maybe Dashtakī doesn't really mean that *both* have to be actualized.
-   Maybe he just means that it is not *enough* for Z to be actualized,
    because the second-order declarative, ZT or ZF, also needs to be actualized.

:::

-   It is unclear exactly how we are to understand the 'as if'.
-   Roughly, the idea seems to be that the semantics of 'All my speeches are
    false' requires us to consider falsity twice, first, as the judged-about,
    and second, as what is judged of the judged-about.

## Puzzles {auto-animate=true}

This seems to be how he wants us to think of the situation:

:::{data-id=1}
   L~1~   L~2~    L~2~ is true    L~2~ is false
  ------ ------ ---------------- ----------------
    ?      ✗     not correct      not correct
    ✗      ?     not correct      not correct
:::

-   The judgments in columns 3 and 4 represent his position on the Liar: it is
    not correct to say that it is true, and not correct to say it is false.
-   As we've seen, his argument doesn't the position in the last row.

:::{data-id=1}
   L~1~   L~2~    L~2~ is true    L~2~ is false

    ✗      F     not correct      correct
:::


:::nonincremental
-   Maybe that row can be ruled out?
-   If you need to say the same thing twice, and you only say it once,
    then it is always the *second* saying that goes missing?
:::

## Puzzles {auto-animate=true}

:::{data-id=1}
   L~1~   L~2~    L~2~ is true    L~2~ is false
  ------ ------ ---------------- ----------------
    ?      ✗     not correct      not correct
:::

-   That '?' is worrisome:
    -   We can't replace it with an '✗': then the speaker will have failed to actualize *any* declarative.
    -   One option: L~1~ is either true or false, but, either way, this doesn't lead to a contradiction.
    -   But that's weird, because those truth values would be entirely ungrounded.

## Trouble

C
:   This saying is composed.

-   al-Dashtakī and al-Dawānī agree that this is true.
-   'Composed' here is a word borrowed from grammar. It refers *syntactic*
    composition, independent of the *semantics* of any specific mode of
    composition (e.g., declarative, imperative, etc.)
-   Presumably, just as with the Liar, when someone says C, it is *as if* they said "'This saying is composed' is composed"
-   And that declarative "considers composing" twice:

      C~1~    C~2~    C~2~ is true     C~2~ is false
    ------- ------- ---------------- -----------------
       ?       ✗      not correct      not correct

-   al-Dashtakī says: no, my principle does not apply, because C does not consider *truth* or *falsity* twice.
-   On our interpretation, that seems entirely irrelevant.

# Conclusion

## Ibn ʿAdī and al-Dashtakī: a comparison

-   Ibn ʿAdī says that the Liar as declared-about lacks truth value, so the Liar as declarative is false.
-   Dashtakī says that the Liar requires two declaratives, but (we've argued), while the first exists, the second does not, so
    the Liar lacks truth value.
-   As we see it, these are two variants on the same basic solution:

    :::{data-id=1}
                   L~1~   L~2~  
    ------------  ------ ------ 
    al-Dashtakī     ?      ✗    
    Ibn ʿAdī        ✗      F
