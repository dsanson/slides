# Introduction

## *The Final Word: al-Dawani and the Liar Paradox in the Islamic World*

:::nonincremental
-   How it began:
    -   al-Dawānī (d. 1502)'s treatise, *The Final Word in Solving the Paradox
        of the Irrational Root*, looks neat! Let's translate it and
        reconstruct what it says.

-   What it's become:
    -   an overly ambitious attempt to reconstruct the entire known history of
        the paradox within the Islamic world, up to and including al-Dawānī.

-   Why this happened:
    -   al-Dawānī discusses several earlier proposals, offering partial
        quotes, so we chased those back to their sources.
    -   turns out he isn't always faithful to his sources, and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some important figures.fragment , and ignores (or is
        ignorant of) some curious uses of the Liar in theological
        contexts.

## Our two characters

### Yaḥyá Ibn ʿAdī (893--947)

::: nonincremental
-   Syriac Christian, working in Baghdad.
-   Student of Abū Bishr Mattā; student or colleague of al-Fārābī.
-   Prolific translator, commentator, and author of his own treatises.
-   Known in his time especially for his work on logic.

### Sadr al-Dīn al-Dashtakī (d. 1498)

::: nonincremental
-   Philosopher living and working in Shiraz during the Safavid period.
-   Contemporary of, and interlocutor with, al-Dawānī.
-   *The Final Word* is the final word in *their* extended debate about the
    Liar---so he is a central figure for us.
:::

# Ibn ʿAdī on the Liar

## Texts and Context

-    Abū Bishr Mattā argued that logic is better than grammar because

     > logic investigates meaning (*maʿnā*) whereas grammar
     > investigates utterance (*lafẓ*).

-   In two closely related works, Ibn ʿAdī defends this view, in part by
    showing how we can use logic to solve the Liar:

    -   *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic* (edited text in progress)
    -   A solutions manual to *Explaining, *The Virtues of Logic* (edited text in @ibnadi1988 [201--205])

:::notes
-   Full title: *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic by Describing how
    it Benefits People \[by endowing them\] with Powers \[to dissolve
    problems\] that it is Impossible for the other Arts of Language to Solve*.

-   Was long lost. Part of the Tehran codex Marwī 19 discovered by Robert Wisnovsky
    (@wisnovsky2012). Robert and Ahmed are working on producing an edited version.
:::

## *Explaining the Virtue of the Art of Logic* 

-   Part I:

    > Logicians divide the saying, 'The standing other than the
    > sitting (*al-qāʾim ghayr al-qāʿid*),' in 16384 ways \[=$2^14$\], as we
    > will explain, whereas the other practical arts are unable to do so.

-   Part II:

    > Another benefit of logic is to dissolve some common problems that were
    > brought by the sophists.

-   One of those four problems is the Liar.

-   Solutions are left as an exercise to the reader.

-   Luckily, a friend reached out, and asked for a solution manual. In *Virtues*, we get his solution to the Liar.

:::notes
There are some slides at the end of this deck that briefly describe the other three problems.
:::

## The Liar

> Tell us about [he who says, 'All my sayings (*qawl*) are false]{.fragment
> .highlight-green },' [if he has not spoken
> before]{.fragment .highlight-green}, other than by
> declaring the falsity of them as a whole.
> Do you judge his saying to be false or true? For if you necessitate that it
> is true, then it must be false, and this necessarily entails that his saying
> is true and false together, and it is one saying.

-   Pretty much the standard form the Liar takes throughout the tradition.
-   Popular later variants are:
    -   He who says, 'All my sayings at this moment are false,' and says nothing else in that moment.
    -   He who says, 'All my sayings in this house are false,' and says nothing else in that house.

:::notes
-   There are also Liar cycles.
-   Pretty much all the examples are what Kripke would call *Contingent* Liars, and the solutions are meant to be sensitive to that.

## Ibn ʿAdī's Solution {auto-animate=true}

> For in entering into its totality, and declaring about the totality of which
> it is one, the saying is a declarative about itself too, and [it becomes a declarative (*khabar*) and
> a declared-about (*mukhbar ʿanhu*)]{.fragment  .highlight-current-green}. And
> [each declarative that is posited as a declared-about, exits (*yakhruj*) in this
> condition from being a declarative]{.fragment  .highlight-current-green}.
> [So, this saying, insofar as it is a declaring about itself, is not a
> declarative]{.fragment  .highlight-current-green}, and [each saying that is not a declarative is neither true nor false]{.fragment  .highlight-current-green}, and [if this saying is posited as \[a
> declared-about\] it is neither true nor false]{.fragment  .highlight-current-green}.

:::{data-id=1}
-   The Liar is false, because it declares that its declared-about is false, but its declared-about is neither true nor false. [Oh, right: also, it is identical to its declared-about.]{.fragment}
-   That sounds like a contradiction: how can one declarative be both neither true nor
    false, but also false?
-   Because of what happens to
    a declarative (*khabar*) when it is made into a declared-about: in that
    condition, it "exits from being a declarative".
:::

:::notes
A "declared-about" (*mukhbar ʿanhu*) is the subject of a declarative. If I
say, 'Zayd is sitting', Zayd, the man, is the declared-about. If I say, 'All
my students are from Illinois', each individual student is a declared-abouts.
:::


## Ibn ʿAdī's Solution {auto-animate=true}

## Exiting from being a declarative

> As for [the claim that] if the declarative is posited as a
> declared-about, it exits in this condition from being a declarative,
> this is something that can be explained by induction. For [if you say '"Zayd
> is standing" is a declarative']{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index=1}, and '"ʿAmru is running" is a declarative',
> and '"Bread is beneficial" \[...\],' [you are not declaring]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}, in all
> these sayings, that Zayd is standing, or that ʿAmru is running, or that
> Bread is beneficial, and this applies to all other declaratives.

1.  [When I declare, '"Zayd is standing" is a declarative', I do not declare 'Zayd is standing'.]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index=1}
2.  Likewise in other cases.
3.  So, [when a declarative is made the declared-about of another declarative, it exits from being a declarative.]{data-id=1}

## Declaring makes the declarative

-   Ibn ʿAdī here makes the standard Aristotelian assumption that what makes a
    saying a declarative---the glue that binds words into truth-apt
    representations---is the act of declaring.

-   For example, in *al Qiyas* V 236, Avicenna discusses the status of propositions that
    are parts of conditionals:

    > \[When\] a condition is \[stated\], each of two parts will no longer
    > be a proposition (*qaddiya*).

-   So, he goes on to say, they are neither true nor false, and so cannot be assented to or doubted.

-   The Aristotelian reasons for thinking that propositions, when made parts
    of a conditional, lose their status as propositions, equally support Ibn
    ʿAdī's claim that declaratives, when quoted, lose their status as
    declaratives.

## A Davidsonian thought about quotation 

-   When you quote a passage in order to say something about it, you do *two* things:

    -    You *present* or *display* the passage, for your audience to consider.
    -    You say something *about* the displayed passage.

-   Perhaps Ibn ʿAdī's idea can be put this way: 
 
    -    As a declared-about, a declarative is *displayed*, and when a declarative is *displayed*, it is not declared.

-   This suggests a distinction between the declarative as it is *in itself*,
    according to its nature as a declarative, and as it is *when displayed*,
    that is, *as a declared-about*.

## A few pretty obvious objections

1.  Induction from a non-representative sample: in quotations, the declared-abouts are displayed. But that's something special about quotations. If I say, 'That thing you said is true', I have declared something about what you said, but I have not displayed it. (Note that plausibly, the Liar *does* display its declared-about.)
 
2.  Identity: some declared-abouts, like the Liar, are numerically identical
    to the declaratives that declare about them.
    -   In such cases, there *is* an act of declaring, gluing the words
        together into a truth-apt representation.
    -   Why is that glue dissolved when that very declarative is also declared-about?
  
3.  Implausible consequences, ineffability and self-defeat:
    a.  On this view, 'Some saying is a declarative' is false, but that is
        implausible.
    b.  On this view, every feature, F, of a declarative, D, that depends on
        it being a declarative becomes ineffable: when you say, 'D is F', as
        declared-about, D exits from being a declarative, so does not have F.
    c.  Ibn ʿAdī himself relies on claims about declaratives that depend on
        their being declaratives. By his own account, all those claims are
        false.

## Ibn ʿAdī's source for the Liar?

-   If we have time! See the end of these slides.
   
# Al-Dashtakī on the Liar

## Texts

-   We rely primarily on Dawānī's report of Dashtakī's view in *The Final
    Word*. For edited text, see @qaramaleki2007 [124--128].
-   See also Dashtakī's *Risala*, and his glosses on Qūshjī's commentary on
    Ṭūsī's Tajrīd, both also edited in @qaramaleki2007.
   
## Al-Dashtakī's proposed solution

> [Falsity is considered in this specific saying twice]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}, and [being considered twice,
> this requires two declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth and
> falsity to it]{.fragment fragment-index="2" .highlight-current-green}.
> Since [only one declarative is actualized]{.fragment
> .highlight-current-green fragment-index=3}, it is clear to you
> that [it is not correct to attribute to this saying truth, and not \[correct
> to attribute\] falsity]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index=4}.

::: nonincremental
1.  [The Liar considers falsity twice.]{.fragment
    .highlight-current-green fragment-index="1"}
2.  [A declarative that considers truth or falsity twice requires, for it to be correct to attribute it truth or falsity, the
    actualization of two declaratives.]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index="2"}
3.  [The speaker only actualizes one declarative.]{.fragment
    .highlight-current-green fragment-index="3"}
4.  So, [it is not correct to attribute truth or falsity to the
    Liar.]{.fragment .highlight-current-green fragment-index="4"}
5.   That is, the Liar is neither true nor false.

:::{data=id=2}
-   That is, 'A is true' and 'A is false' are both *affirmative* attributions, so
both require *for their truth* the existence of A.
-   This is the standard Aristotelian view that affirmatives have existential import.
-   The "standard package" adds:
    -    Affirmatives with empty subjects are not true, and so false.

## An alternative interpretation

@zarepour2023 [12--13] says,

> Dashtakī's argument here seems to be based on a version of what is today
> called the Principle of Compositionality. 

On this interpretation, if 'A' is empty, 'A is true', 'A is false', 'A is not
true', and 'A is not false' are all semantically defective, and so
meaningless (unless we add something fancy about the semantics of 'not').

:::{.fragment}
For a long time, we read al-Dashtakī this way too. But now we think that this is a
mistake. We take al-Dashtaki's reasoning about the Liar to depend only on the "standard package" described above.

-   As when we considered Ibn ʿAdī, '✗' does not indicate a truth value.
    There, it indicated that the saying in that condition was not a
    declarative. Here, it indicates that the declarative is not actualized.

-   On our preferred interpretation, "correct" here means "true", and "false"
    is the metathetic negation of "true", so any declarative that is not
    correct is therefore false.

-   Roughly, the "as if" idea seems to be that the semantics of 'All my speeches are
    false' requires us to consider falsity twice, first, as the judged-about,
    and second, as what is judged of the judged-about.

## Puzzles {auto-animate=true}

How he wants us to think of the situation: L requires two declaratives, but only one of them is actualized, so it is not correct to say that L is true or that it is false. That is, imagining that L~1~ and L~2~ are the two required declaratives:

:::{data-id=1}
   L~1~   L~2~    L~2~ is true    L~2~ is false
  ------ ------ ---------------- ----------------
    ?      ✗     not C            not C      
    ✗      ?     not C            not C      
:::

-   But as we've seen, he is not entitled, by his own principles and forms of
    argument, to the last row.

:::

-   Can we rule out that last row, on independent grounds?
-   If you need to say the same thing twice, and you only say it once, then
    maybe it is always the *second* saying that goes missing?
-   Let's eliminate it.

  ------ ------ ---------------- ----------------
    ?      ✗     not C            not C      
:::

-   That '?' is worrisome.
-   We can't say L~1~ goes missing. For then, either *no* declarative is
    actualized, which isn't al-Dashtakī's view; or L~2~ is actualized but L~1~ is not, but that's the row we just eliminated.
-   So either L~1~ is true, or it is false.
-   Perhaps L~1~ is false because it has an empty subject, L~0~. But this recreates our eliminated row, shifted one column left.
-   In fact, any assignment of truth value to L~1~ is a problem. For what
    stops *us* from then correctly saying that L~1~ has *that* truth value,
    collapsing the entire structure of al-Dashtakī's solution?

# Conclusion

## Ibn ʿAdī and al-Dashtakī: a comparison 

-   Both Ibn ʿAdī and al-Dashtakī agree that, in some circumstances, a
    declarative is neither true nor false.
-   For Ibn ʿAdī, this is when it is actualized as a declared-about, and so
    exits from being a declarative.
-   For Dashtakī, this is when it is not actualized, and so goes missing.
-   If we use '✗' in a neutral way, to indicate that the declarative in
    question fails, for whatever reason, to be true or false, then we can
    represent their views in a simple table:
   
    :::
                   L~1~   L~2~  
    ------------  ------ ------ 
    al-Dashtakī     ?      ✗    
    Ibn ʿAdī        ✗      F    
    :::

# Appendices and References

## Ibn ʿAdī's source for the Liar?

-   @endress1977  suggests that Ibn ʿAdī's sources for the Liar were
    Aristotle's *Sophistical Refutations 25*, and Alexander's commentary on
    *SR*.
-   Not *SR* 25:
    -   *SR* 25 at best *suggests* the Liar [@spade1973a] 
    -   The suggestive example from *SR* 25---a man who "at the same time says what is both false and
    true"---is omitted from many of the Arabic translations, including Ibn
    ʿAdī's [@alwishah2009a, 99]
-   Not Alexander's commentary on *SR*:
    -   because it is spurious, written by Michael of Ephesus in the 12th century CE.
-   Could be Alexander's commentary on *Topics* II.7:
    -   Not spurious, and he discusses the Liar! 
    -   Ibn ʿAdī says he consulted it when writing his own commentary on *Topics*! 
    -   But he also says that his copy was missing Alexander's commentary on books II, III, and IV [@endress1977, 25].

:::notes

Our guess: puzzles like the Liar were part of the standard logic curriculum, presented as exercises to students by teachers.

## Everyone who says he is donkey is truthful

>| Everyone who says he is an animal is truthful. 
>| So, everyone who says he is donkey is truthful.

## Every man has many species

>| Every man is an animal. 
>| Animal has many species.
>| So every man has many species.

More or less a standard puzzle from antiquity. 

## Either rock is animal or animal is not animal

> Body is either animal or not animal. Necessarily, if something is true of

> body is animal, this entails that rock is animal, since rock is body and, by

A puzzle about Aristotle's *dictum de omni et nullo* (*Categories* 1b
10-15) that the later Islamic tradition associates with Isagoge.
