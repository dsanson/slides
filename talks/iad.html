<h2>The Liar</h2>
<p>Here is how he presents the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell us about he who says, ‘All my sayings are false,’ if he has not
spoken before, other than by declaring the falsity of them as a whole.
Do you judge his saying to be false or true? For if you insist that it
is true, then it must be false, and this necessarily entails that his
saying is true and false together, and it is one saying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TODO: add citation</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This is the standard form the Liar takes throughout the tradition. It
is a Contingent Liar, in Kripke’s sense, and obviously so. Generally
speaking, proposed solutions will be sensitive to that.</p>

<section id="ibn-ʿadīs-solution" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ibn ʿAdī’s Solution</h2>
<p>The Liar is false:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This saying (<em>al-qawl</em>) is false, and it is not possibly
true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is false because one of his sayings is not false:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For he is declaring about the totality of [his] sayings
(<em>aqqāwilī</em>), and one of them is the saying that all of them are
false, and it is not the case that the totality of other sayings that he
declared (<em>khabar</em>) to be false are false. Hence the saying that
they are false is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s weird, because the Liar is supposed to be his only
saying.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>For in entering into its totality, and declaring about the totality
of which it is one, <span class="fragment highlight-current-red">the
saying is a declarative about itself</span>, too, and <span
class="fragment highlight-current-red">it becomes a declarative
(<em>khabar</em>) and a declared-about (<em>mukhbar ʿanhu</em>)</span>.
And <span class="fragment highlight-current-red">each declarative that
is posited as a declared-about, exits in this condition from being a
declarative</span>. <span class="fragment highlight-current-red">So,
this saying, insofar as it is a declaring about itself, is not a
declarative</span>, and <span
class="fragment highlight-current-red">each saying that is not a
declarative is neither true nor false</span>, and <span
class="fragment highlight-current-red">if this saying is posited as [a
declared-about] it is neither true nor false</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>A “declared-about” (<em>mukhbar ʿanhu</em>) is the subject of a
declarative. If I say, ‘Zayd is sitting’, Zayd, the man, is the
declared-about. If I say, ‘All my students are from Illinois’, each
individual student is a declared-abouts.</p>

<p>And because <span class="fragment highlight-current-red">it is
declaring about itself that it is false, in the case in which it is
neither true nor false</span>, it is false and must not be true. For in
order for it to be true it must declare about itself that it is false in
the case in which it is false, and it must not be the subject of a
declaration of its own falsehood, for in that case, it is not a
declarative, and therefore it cannot be true when it declares about
itself that it is false. And this is the solution to this problem.</p>

<h2>Exiting</h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>When a declarative is posited as a declared-about, it “exits in this
condition from being” a declarative.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>As for [the claim that] if the declarative is posited as a
declared-about, it exits in this condition from being a declarative,
this is something that can be explained by induction. For if you say
‘“Zayd is standing” is a declarative’, and ‘“ʿAmran is running” is a
declarative’, and ‘“Bread is beneficial” […],’ you are not declaring, in
all these sayings, that Zayd is standing, or that ʿAmran is running, or
that Bread is beneficial, and this applies to all other
declaratives.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="all-declaratives-must-be-declared" class="slide level2">
<h2>All declaratives must be declared</h2>
<p>The background idea here seems to be that if a saying is not
<em>declared</em>, it is not a declarative.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Z</dt>
<dd>
Zayd is standing.
</dd>
<dt>ZD</dt>
<dd>
‘Zayd is standing’ is a declarative.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When I declare ZD, I do not declare Z. Since Z is not declared, it is
not a declarative. So ZD is false.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Note that it is in many ways similar to the Frege-Geach point: when I
declare a conditional, I do not declare the antecedent or consequent.
Yet, for purposes of analysis, we want the antecedent and consequent to
retain the semantic features granted on the Aristotelian picture only to
declaratives. The same is true about quotation, especially when we want
to use quotation to discuss the semantic features of the quoted
sayings.</p>
<p>It is not as though Aristotelians weren’t aware of these problems.
Avicenna, for example, is quite explicit about the point that the parts
of a hypothetical judgment are not themselves judged.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="a-davidsonian-thought" class="slide level2">
<h2>A Davidsonian Thought</h2>
<p>Here is a lovely quote from <span class="citation"
data-cites="recanati2001">@recanati2001 [639]</span>, about
quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In quotation, as several authors have emphasized (Christensen 1967,
Searle 1969, §4.1, Read forthcoming), the quoted material is displayed
or presented. That means that a token is produced and the attention of
the audience is drawn to that token. To be sure, whenever one says
something, one produces (tokens of) words, with the intention that the
audience perceive them. Yet one does not normally intend the addressee
to pay conscious attention to the words one utters. In linguistic
communication, the words are automatically processed, and audience
attention is drawn to what one says rather than to the means by which
one says it. When words are mentioned, however, the medium itself is
brought to the forefront of attention: the words are displayed,
exhibited. This is a form of ostension, as Davidson and others have
pointed out, but it differs from ordinary ostension in one respect: the
ostended token does not exist independently of the act of ostending it.
When I point to a bird, the bird exists independent of my pointing, but
when I mention a word, the ostended token is produced—it comes into
being—through the very act of ostensive display.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="applying-that-distinction" class="slide level2">
<h2>Applying that Distinction</h2>
<p>The kind of quotation involved in ZD involves two distinct acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The act of producing ‘Zayd is standing’ to be <em>presented or
displayed</em>.</li>
<li>The act of declaring, about that, that it is a declarative.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Ibn ʿAdī says, the first act is not an act of declaring. So the
<em>displayed</em> saying—the saying as declared-about—is not a
declarative. If it is the act of declaring that making a saying truth
apt, the <em>displayed</em> saying, ‘Zayd is standing’, is not truth
apt.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-all-declared-abouts" class="slide level2">
<h2>Not all declared-abouts…</h2>
<p>What if someone <em>else</em> declares Z, and then I declare,</p>
<dl>
<dt>ZD*</dt>
<dd>
What they said is a declarative.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does <em>their</em> declarative, when posited as a declared-about,
also exit from being a declarative?</p>
<p>To be sure, <em>I</em> don’t declare it when I declare ZD*. But
<em>they</em> declared it. Why should it lose its declarativity when I
go to declare something about it?</p>
</section>
<section id="ineffability-and-self-defeat" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ineffability and Self-defeat</h2>
<p>Ibn ʿAdī makes all sorts of declarative claims about declaratives.
But his own analysis appears to say that, the moment you try to talk
<em>about</em> a declarative, it exits from being a declarative.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-to-the-liar" class="slide level2">
<h2>Back to the Liar</h2>
<p>The funky thing about L, on this analysis, is that it would appear to
be produced in a <em>single act</em>, <em>both</em> to be displayed,
<em>and</em> as an act of declaring something about itself.</p>
<p>Surely in that case, at least, a declarative need not lose its status
as declarative in the condition of being a declared-about?</p>
<p>Later in the tradition, Fakr al-Din al-Razi (1149-1210) will argue
that these acts <em>must</em> be distinct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the declarative about something is later in order than the
declared-about (<em>mukhbar ’anhu</em>). So if we made the declarative
the same as the declared-about, then that entails that the thing is
later in order than itself, and that is impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unclear from context whether ‘later in order’ here means later
in <em>time</em>, or later in some logical or conceptual order. Perhaps
Ibn ʿAdī has something like this idea in mind.</p>
