<li class="fragment">Why this happened:

<h1>A Davidsonian Thought from <span class="citation"

<blockquote>
<p>In quotation, as several authors have emphasized (Christensen 1967,
Searle 1969, §4.1, Read [1997]), the quoted material is displayed or
presented. That means that a token is produced and the attention of the
audience is drawn to that token. To be sure, whenever one says
something, one produces (tokens of) words, with the intention that the
audience perceive them. Yet one does not normally intend the addressee
to pay conscious attention to the words one utters. […] When words are
mentioned, however, the medium itself is brought to the forefront of
attention: the words are displayed, exhibited. This is a form of
ostension, as Davidson and others have pointed out, but it differs from
ordinary ostension in one respect: the ostended token does not exist
independently of the act of ostending it. When I point to a bird, the
bird exists independent of my pointing, but when I mention a word, the
ostended token is produced—it comes into being—through the very act of
ostensive display.</p>

<p>If you say: If what has been determined is correct, namely, that the
correctness and truth of a judgment is by its correspondence to the
external or the <em>nafs al-amr</em>, and its falsity by its absence,
[then this] entails that truth and falsity are not conjoined in one
declarative. But they may be conjoined in it, as in the saying of he who
says, ‘All my speeches at this moment are false’: if he does not speak
at the mentioned moment, other than this speech, then the truth of his
declarative entails its falsity and vis versa. <span class="citation"

(2023)</span> (a lovely paper!) suggests that Dashtakī’s reasoning
relies on the Principle of Compositionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dashtakī’s argument here seems to be based on a version of what is
today called the Principle of Compositionality. Roughly speaking, this
principle states that the meaning […] of a complex phrase is determined
by the meaning [..] of its components and the rules through which they
are combined and put together. A consequence of such a principle is that
[…] such a sentence does not express any semantic content at all.
Moreover, if a sentence does not express a semantic content, it will not
be either true or false. No meaningless sentence is truth-apt. <span

is a mistake, and his reasoning just depends on the much weaker and more

<blockquote>
<p><a href="#/samarqandi3.2">¶</a> It is <em>as if</em> he spoke this
speech, and then said again, ‘This speech is false.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither Dashtakī nor Samarqandī are claiming that this
<em>is</em> what the speaker said. The idea is instead that this is how
we need to <em>understand</em> what the speaker did, where this
understanding is what should guide our semantic analysis. And this is an
idea we can see all the way back in Ibn ʿAdī: we need to distinguish the
act of putting the speech on the table, as it were—that is,
<em>displaying or presenting</em> the speech—from the act of
<em>declaring</em> or <em>judging</em> something about that speech. Here
is Dashtakī’s explanation of this idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying that the one who judges (<em>hākim</em>) [the
declarative] is aware of the condition of the judgment, that is, that
his speech is this specific saying, rather I say that he is judging a
judgment that reaches and covers this saying, and its truth is by
affirmation of the predicate to this saying, and its falsity is by the
absence of that affirmation. (Qaramelki, <em>Risala</em>, p. 56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposing we grant all this, we now come to the pay-off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="#/fw76"></a> And it becomes apparent that the falsity is
considered in this specific saying twice, and being considered twice,
this requires two declaratives for it to be correct to attribute truth
and falsity to it. Since only one declarative is actualized, it is clear
to you that it is not correct to attribute to this saying truth, and not
[correct to attribute] falsity. And it weighs the same as your saying,
“‘Zayd’s sentence is false,’ is true”, or “false”, if Zayd has no
declarative except one. Reflect on that!</p>
